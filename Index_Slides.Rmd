# Key Findings: Risk Perception & Reality

.pull-left[
### **The Perception Gap**

- **Significant divergence** between actual and perceived risks
- Risk perception shaped by:
  - Socioeconomic factors
  - Cultural context  
  - Environmental experience
- Influences insurance adoption decisions
]

.pull-right[
### **Workshop Insights**

**Risk Dimensions:**
- **Objective Risks**: Climate hazards, market volatility
- **Perceived Risks**: Cultural beliefs, past experiences  
- **Insurance Impact**: Mediated by perception gaps

**Critical Insight**: Insurance design must account for both objective and perceived risks

# Modeling Approach: From Concept to Simulation

.pull-left[
### **Conceptual Model Development**

- Analyzes interplay between:
  - Objective risks (climate, markets)
  - Perceived risks (farmer perspectives)
- Identifies decision pathways
- Integrates local and scientific knowledge
]

.pull-right[
### **Digital Implementation**

**Model Specifications:**
- Simulation Type ‚Üí Monte Carlo
- Iterations ‚Üí 10,000

# Results: Insurance Impact on Resilience

.pull-left[
### **Climate Shock Resilience**

- **Insured systems**: Higher resilience to climate shocks
- **Reduced conversion**: Lower likelihood of switching to monocultures
- **Economic stability**: Better risk management capabilities
]

.pull-right[
### **Comparative Analysis**

**System Performance:**
- Agroforestry + Insurance ‚Üí High resilience, High biodiversity
- Agroforestry Only ‚Üí Medium resilience, High biodiversity  
- Monoculture ‚Üí Low resilience, Low biodiversity

**Key Finding**: Insurance coverage correlates with sustained agroforestry practices
